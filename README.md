# Node interview of ElemeFE

## What's this?

We were looking for developer which had three years development experience with Node.js & Backend dev.

This is the interview Index about it, and it shows you how to pass the Node.js interview of ElemeFE.

## What is ElemeFE?

It means Frontend team of Eleme (饿了么) which seems like the biggest takeaway company of China.

There are some public projects of Eleme:

* [Element](http://element.eleme.io/#/en-US) A Vue.js 2.0 UI Toolkit for Web.
* [Element-react](https://github.com/eleme/element-react) React.js version for Element.
* [Mint UI](http://mint-ui.github.io/#!/en) Mobile UI elements for Vue.js.
* [restc](https://elemefe.github.io/restc/) A server-side middleware to visualize REST requests.
* [vue-infinite-scroll](https://github.com/ElemeFE/vue-infinite-scroll) An infinite scroll directive for vue.js.

As you see, we are frontend team, but we've been doing some backend job to support frontend to gain more.
