## Summary

With diffrence between frontend, there are few chance to work with DOM in backend. So we won't discuss about it. Unlike browser side, backend is directly facing memory, while the work duration is calculated by year, we do  more concern about the machine side.

## Type judgement

We suffer tortuously from type judgement in JavaScript. Otherwise, TypeScript may not be created. Basically, we recommend to read the source code of [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).

Generally, this is a simple opening of an interview. We won't deny a candidate only because of not knowing the value of `undefined == null` is `true`. According to our personal experiences, candidate who cannot answer this question is probably to have a poor foundation. If you have no concept of such kind of question, you may reflect on whether to find a JavaScript book to review for basis.

Additionally, it is a bonus point if candidate understands TypeScript or flow.
